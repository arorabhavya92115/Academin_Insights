Student Performance Analytics Dashboard
This project analyzes the Student Performance dataset sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabeelqureshitiii/student-performance-dataset
Which originally contains 1,000,000 rows of realistic student data. For this project, a subset of 10,000 rows was used to make analysis and visualization manageable while retaining meaningful trends. The analysis focuses on how weekly self-study hours, attendance percentage, and class participation affect students’ final scores and grades. The goal is to provide actionable insights for educators and administrators to monitor student performance, identify at-risk students, and guide interventions. In a corporate-style context, this project demonstrates skills in SQL-based data aggregation, KPI calculation, and interactive dashboard creation, similar to employee performance tracking or KPI dashboards.
The dataset includes six columns: student_id, weekly_self_study_hours, attendance_percentage, class_participation, total_score, and grade. Using SQL, multiple queries were written to analyze grade distribution, study hours versus scores, attendance impact, class participation correlation, at-risk students, and top-performer profiles. Aggregated queries were used to produce heatmaps and bubble charts, ensuring visualizations remain clear and actionable even with 10,000 rows. All SQL queries are saved in SQL/analysis_queries.sql for reproducibility.
The project features a Tableau dashboard titled “Student Performance Analytics Dashboard”, which combines four visualizations: a grade distribution bar chart, study hours vs total score line chart, attendance vs score bar chart, class participation vs score scatter plot, an aggregated heatmap for at-risk students, and a bubble chart profiling top performers. The dashboard includes interactive filters for grades, study hours, and attendance ranges, enabling users to explore trends, clusters, and potential areas for intervention.
All resources are included in this repository: the subset dataset (student_performance.csv), the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), screenshots of the visualizations, and SQL queries. The interactive dashboard can also be accessed via Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bhavya.arora2258/viz/AcademinPerormanceInsights/Dashboard1
This project serves as an end-to-end demonstration of data analysis, visualization, and actionable insight generation, suitable for academic or portfolio purposes.
